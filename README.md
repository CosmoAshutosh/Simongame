# Simon Game

## Description:
This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. Simon is a memory game where the computer generates a sequence of colors and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through the levels.
